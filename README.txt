### About the Files
This repository contains two Python files: `functions.py` and `main.py`. Here's a quick overview of what each file does:

1. **`functions.py`**:
   - This file holds reusable functions. Think of it as a toolbox where all the core logic is written. 
   - The functions in this file can be imported and used in other scripts (like `main.py`).
   - If you need to change or add functionality, this is the file to update.

2. **`main.py`**:
   - This is the main script that runs the program.
   - It calls the functions from `functions.py` and combines them to perform tasks or generate results.
   - You can think of it as the "driver" script that ties everything together.

### How to Run
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
   - Install any required libraries (if there are imports in the files). Use:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
     *(If no `requirements.txt` is provided, check the imports in the files and install the necessary libraries manually.)*

2. **Steps**:
   - First, ensure both files (`functions.py` and `main.py`) are in the same folder.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt in that folder.
   - Run the main script using:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

---

### How It Works
- The `main.py` script imports functions from `functions.py`.
- It then uses these functions to perform specific tasks (e.g., calculations, plotting, etc.).
- If you want to change the behavior of the program, tweak the code in `functions.py` or `main.py`.

---

### Modifying the Code
- To add new functionality, define the function in `functions.py` and call it from `main.py`.
- To debug or test, you can add print statements or use a debugger.

### Notes
- If you encounter any errors, check the following:
  - Ensure all required Python libraries are installed.
  - Double-check for typos or incorrect paths.

Thatâ€™s it! If you have any questions, just drop a comment in the code, and itâ€™ll be easier for anyone to help you out. ðŸ˜Š
